## My name is Bailey, welcome to my profile!

# About Me
Hi there! I'm an aspiring programmer 💻 and environmental/climate scientist 🌱. <br> I'm constantly looking for and exploring new ways to combine the two displines in order to complete projects that have a tangible and positive impact on my community. 

# Projects, Skills, and Hobbies
I don't have much to show yet, but I'm working on new projects all the time! Check out my repositories to see what I'm doing now. <br> I'm currently learning:
- Python & R (for Scientific Computing, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization)
- C++
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

I am also using ArcGIS Pro to create maps and visualizations. (Portfolio WIP)
